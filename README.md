# fscore

This code is my Python code to automatically extract Joseph Piotroski's F-SCORE from 10-years of quarterly historical market data of the Indonesian Stock Market (supplied by an Excel file). 

Piotroski's F-Score is a financial scoring system developed by Joseph Piotroski in his seminal paper, titled "Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers," published in 2000. It is designed to assess the fundamental strength of a company based on its financial statements. The F-Score consists of nine criteria that evaluate various aspects of a company's financial health. Each criterion is assigned a score of 0 or 1, and the scores are then summed up to calculate the overall F-Score.

The nine criteria used in Piotroski's F-Score are:

1. Net Income: Positive net income in the current year.
2. Return on Assets (ROA): Positive ROA in the current year.
3. Operating Cash Flow: Positive operating cash flow in the current year.
4. Change in ROA: Higher ROA in the current year compared to the previous year.
5. Accruals: Lower ratio of operating cash flow to total assets in the current year compared to the previous year.
6. Gross Margin: Higher gross margin in the current year compared to the previous year.
7. Asset Turnover: Higher asset turnover ratio in the current year compared to the previous year.
8. Long-Term Debt: Lower ratio of long-term debt to total assets in the current year compared to the previous year.
9. Equity Issuance: No new issuance of common shares in the current year.

A company can achieve a maximum F-Score of 9 if it satisfies all nine criteria. A higher F-Score indicates better financial health and suggests that the company may be a good investment opportunity. Conversely, a lower F-Score implies weaker fundamentals and may indicate potential financial distress.

Piotroski's F-Score is a popular tool among value investors and can help identify companies with improving financial conditions. However, it is important to note that the F-Score is just one of many factors to consider when evaluating investment opportunities, and it should be used in conjunction with other analysis techniques for a comprehensive assessment.
